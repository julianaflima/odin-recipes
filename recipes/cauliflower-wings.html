	<h3>Description</h3>

	<p>They’re tender and soft on the inside, while being crispy on the outside. It’s almost a bit creepy how close they are to the real thing!</p>

	<p>They can easily be made gluten-free by substituting the all-purpose flour with chickpea flour.</p>

	<p>Without further ado, let's go to the recipe!</p>

	<h4>Ingredients:</h4>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>1 head of cauliflower</li>
		<li>chickpea or regular all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>unsweetened plant-based milk</li>
		<li>garlic powder</li>
		<li>paprika powder</li>
		<li>spicy BBQ sauce</li>
		<li>panko breadcrumbs (omit for gluten-free version)</li>
		<li>salt and pepper</li>
		<li>sriracha sauce</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Steps</h4>

	<ol>
		<li>Carefully cut the cauliflower into bite-sized florets.</li>
		<li>In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, the plant-based milk, the water, the garlic power, the paprika powder, the salt, and the black pepper. Stir until well combined.</li>
		<li>Dip the florets into the batter, so they’re completely coated.</li>
		<li>Roll them in the panko breadcrumbs. Omit this step for a gluten-free version. However, they’re way crispier with the panko breadcrumb coating.</li>
		<li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the cauliflower florets on the baking sheet. Don’t put them on top of each other. Bake for 25 minutes at 350<sup>o</sup>F.</li>
		<li>Transfer the cooked cauliflower wings to a bowl.</li>
		<li>Combine the BBQ  sauce with a teaspoon sriracha sauce and pour it over the baked cauliflower wings. Evenly coat them from all sides by stirring them a few times.</li>
		<li>Put the coated hot wings back on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
		<li>Bake again for 20 minutes at 350<sup>o</sup>F.</li>
		<li>Serve immediately and sprinkle with the green onions and serve with vegan aioli or vegan ranch sauce. Enjoy!</li>
